What does it do?
----------------

Powermail Cleaner offers a new command (scheduler task) to delete old form answers including related uploads.
Further you get a new option in the backend view to cleanup all answers (or only the selected page) restricted to a
given time period in seconds.

Detailed options for storing and deleting answers can be setup via Flexform for each Plugin.
